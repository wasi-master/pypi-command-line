### Download Count

I've included both [PePy](https://pepy.tech/) and [PyPIStats](https://pypistats.org/) since PyPIStats by default does not include mirrors in it's count<sup>[1](https://pypistats.org/faqs#why-are-the-cumulative-download-counts-different-from-the-sum-of)</sup>.

## Installation

- Installing from PyPI (recommended).

  ```sh
  pip install pypi-command-line
  ```

  If you want to also install [speed dependencies](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/notes#speedups)

  ```sh
  pip install "pypi-command-line[speedups]"
  ```

- Installing from source.

  ```sh
  pip install git+https://github.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line.git
  ```

  If you want to also install [speed dependencies](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/notes#speedups)

  ```sh
  pip install "pypi-command-line[speedups] @ git+https://github.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line.git"
  ```

## Usage

To see all the available commands use:

```sh
pypi --help
```

For more information on a certain command use `pypi <command_name> --help`. For example,

```sh
pypi search --help
```

For a full guide see <https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/usage>.

## Alternatives

### [pypi-cli](https://pypi.org/project/pypi-cli/ "pypi-cli")

Now this probably was the best option before `pypi-command-line` came out and it does have some flaws. The `information` command of pypi-cli is pretty minimal, there's no way of seeing the github information, The download count doesn't work properly, the long descriptions aren't formatted at all with pypi-cli. pypi-cli uses the xml-rpc<sup>[<a title="XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC" target="_blank">?</a>]</sup> API that is discontinued So the search feature doesn't work anymore, . The stat command is broken and is badly formatted for screens that are not ultra wide. And the project is unmaintained and archived

**TL;DR** The `stat` and `search` commands don't work anymore, the information command kinda works but the download count doesn't work, can't see github information, descriptions are raw.

### [pypi-client](https://pypi.org/project/pypi-client/ "pypi-client")

So this can just search for packages on pypi and that's it. Now don't you think that this is inherently bad as per se. So I tried it out immediately and it just got stuck loading the packages, pypi-client gets names of all the packages that exist pypi<sup><a title=Reference href="https://github.com/abahdanovich/pypi-client#:~:text=fetches%20all%20package%20names%20from%20pypi" target="_blank">‚Äæ</a></sup> which took like 4 mins, then I assume it downloads the github stars data?<sup><a title=Reference href="https://github.com/abahdanovich/pypi-client#:~:text=downloads%20github%20stars" target="_blank">‚Äæ</a></sup> Which takes like another 3 mins and then It just asked me to authorize with github‚Ä¶ like why does pypi-client even need authorization from me since github has a public api. And then it showed [this](https://i.imgur.com/D0VJhmZ.png "Demo of the program that has been badly formatted") which isn't really unreadable just badly formatted for screens that are not ultra wide. by changing the font size a bit I could make it look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/usU2AnJ.jpeg "Demo of the program after lowering the font size") which still isn't bad just a bit convoluted. And even at the end of the day the results are manually searched through therefore different from pypi<sup><a title=Example href="https://i.imgur.com/2AuCKuX.jpg" target="_blank">‚Äæ</a></sup>

**TL;DR:**
Takes too long (‚âà7 mins), Needs github authorization, badly formatted for non ultra wide monitors, searches manually so results are different compared to pypi

### [yolk](https://pypi.org/project/yolk/ "yolk")

Discontinued 9 years ago, only supports python 2. Uses flags instead of subcommands for everything.

**TL;DR:**
Is this really necessary?

### [qypi](https://pypi.org/project/qypi/ "qypi")

So, this library is most likely the best alternative for pypi-command-line. But the output is in json, uses the xml-rpc api for search which is discontinued, the readme command doesn't work for me, the list command doesn't have a progressbar

**TL;DR:**
Output is only in json, without color. The search command doesn't work anymore. Has no progressbar for long running tasks
